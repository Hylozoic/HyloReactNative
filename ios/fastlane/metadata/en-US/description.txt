Have you ever wondered who all of the amazing people around you are, or how to unlock the creative potential of your community? That's what Hylo is for. 

Hylo is the first social network designed to help you discover who's in your community:  
* Has the skills you need
* Is working on cool projects
* Is available to support you
* Needs your help 

When we share what we’re looking for, what we have to offer, and what we’d like to create in a purpose-aligned community, magic happens.

With Hylo, you can share, in your communities:
* Intentions, of what you'd like to create
* Offers, of what you have that you'd like to share, and
* Requests, for what you're looking for and don't know where to find.

Hylo makes it easy to bring new things into reality with the support of your community.

Hylo is used by hundreds of communities all over the world: alumni groups, startup accelerators, companies, nonprofits, fellowship programs, coworking spaces, schools, maker spaces, ecovillages, and more.
