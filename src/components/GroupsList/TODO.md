To complete this Public Post / Post Editor iteration:

* Add publicPost to savePost
* Add "Make Announcement" pressSelectionRow
* Add "?" pressable to Make Public row which offers explanation
* Make publicPost default true when creating from Public context
* Slightly restructure ImageSelector so it can be triggered from outside for use in pressSelectionLeft TouchableOpacity
* Fix Public icon size / apparent padding with respect to other pressSelection section let icons
* Make remove X on a Group selection appear next to group name, not right justified: Figure out why GroupList remove icon stays right aligned in pressSectionRow even though there seems to be no CSS making this so anymore?
